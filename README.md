# GameLib
### The Library For Games
This is a C++ project to build an SDL2 based application which features multiple games to entertain you.

### Games
- TIC-TAC-TOE
- PONG
- HANGMAN
- SNAKE
- FLAPPY BIRD

### Concept
This comes under our project for Object Oriented Programming Language. The underlying principles and basic conectps of OOPS are the basis of this project.

### Issues
- If your best scores aren't updating, try to run the executable in administrative mode (if not already).
- If there is an error of missing .dll files, try to re-install the package. If the issue stays, download the dll(s) from the project dependancies and store them in the application folder.

We will keep updating this project with different games from time to time.
