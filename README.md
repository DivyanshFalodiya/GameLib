# GameLib
### The Library For Games
This is a C++ project to build an SDL2 based application which features multiple games to entertain you.

### Objective
This comes under our project for Object Oriented Programming Language. The underlying principles and basic conectps of OOPS are the basis of this project.

### Games
- TIC-TAC-TOE
- PONG
- HANGMAN
- SNAKE
- FLAPPY BIRD

### Issues
- If your best scores aren't updating, try to run the executable in administrative mode (if not already).
- If there is an error of missing .dll files, try to re-install the package. If the issue stays, download the dll(s) from the project dependancies and store them in the application folder.
- If the some dlls are still missing, download the latest version of Visual C++ Redistributable [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Setup
You can download the latest version of GameLib [here](https://github.com/DivyanshFalodiya/GameLib/files/5560241/GameLib.zip).

We will keep enhancing this project regularly.
