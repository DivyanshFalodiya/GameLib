# GameLib
### The Library For Games
This is a C++ project to build an SDL2 based application which features multiple games to entertain you.

### Games
- TIC-TAC-TOE
- PONG
- HANGMAN
- SNAKE
- FLAPPY BIRD

### Concept
This comes under our project for Object Oriented Programming Language. The underlying principles and basic conectps of OOPS are the basis of this project.

## Issues
If your best scores aren't updating, try to run the executable in administrative mode.
If there is an error of missing .dll files, make sure that x64 and x86 folders (in the application folder) have all missing dll files. If not, download it from the dependencies

We will keep updating this project with different games from time to time.
